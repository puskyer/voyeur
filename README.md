======

VOYEUR's main purpose is to generate a fast (and pretty) Active Directory report. The tool is developed entirely in PowerShell (a powerful scripting language) without dependencies (just .Net Framework 3.5 and Ofiice Excel if you want an useful and pretty report). The generated report is a perfect starting point for well-established forensic, incident response team, or security researchers who want to quickly analyze threats in Active Directory Services.
